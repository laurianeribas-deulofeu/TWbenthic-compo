<h2><strong><em>Overview</strong></em></h2>
<p>This repository contains the dataset used in the study published in PLOSONE titled "IStructure of benthic communities along the Taiwan latitudinal gradient". The research documents the structure of benthic communities around Taiwan, by comparing its assemblages in four regions, analyzing the effects of the latitudinal gradient, and highlighting regional characteristics. Surveys were performed between 2011 and 2012.</p><br>

<h2><strong><em>Field Survey</strong></em></h2>
Within four major regions, 25 sites around Taiwan were selected for this study, including four in north Taiwan, six at Penghu, four at Green Island, and eleven at Kenting (Fig 1).<br>

<h2><strong><em> Benthic assessment</strong></em></h2>
Benthic communities were conducted in 2011-2012, using five 20-meter-long photo-transects at each site. A total of 105 photographs (0.5 m x 0.5 m) were captured per site. The photographs were analyzed using CPCe v4.0 software, with 50 random points overlaid on each picture to identify benthic organisms at the most reasonable operational taxonomic unit (OTU) possible, considering the limitation of taxonomic identification via photography. Thirteen major categories (hard coral: HC, soft coral: SF, macro-algae: MA, encrusting coralline algae: ECA, turf algae: TU, zoanthids: ZO, sponges: SP, Antipatharia: AT, sea anemones: AN, ascidians: AS, other living organisms: OL, bare substrate: BS, and unknown: UN). <br>
